This project predicts house prices using the **Ames Housing Dataset** and applies machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehallmar/ames-housing-dataset)
- **Target Variable:** \`SalePrice\`
- **Features:** 79 explanatory variables describing residential homes

## 🚀 Features
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✅ Feature Engineering  
✅ Model Training (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)  
✅ Ensemble Learning for Better Accuracy  
✅ Model Saving & Deployment  

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/alinavabz/house-price-prediction.git
   \`\`\`
2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`
3. Run the model:
   \`\`\`bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   \`\`\`

## 📈 Model Performance
| Model         | MAE   | RMSE  |
|--------------|------|------|
| RandomForest | 12.45 | 21.30 |
| XGBoost      | 10.23 | 19.89 |
| **Ensemble**  | **9.56** | **18.45** |

## ✨ Next Steps
- Deploy the model using **Flask/Streamlit**
- Improve accuracy with **Neural Networks**
